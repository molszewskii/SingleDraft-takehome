Is it a good idea to write tests for this feature?
Yes, it is a good idea to write tests for this feature, especially because it involves several key behaviors like:
1. State management (via Zustand) - Ensuring that the state updates correctly when cards are expanded, collapsed, or deleted.
2. UI interactions - Ensuring that user interactions (like clicking the "Expand", "Collapse", "Delete", and "Reveal" buttons) work as expected.

How to approach it?
1. Unit Tests -  testing individual components (like Card and ToggleButton) and their logic:
    - State Change Testing: For example, test that when you click the "Expand" button, the card expands, and the expandedCards state changes correctly.
    - UI Updates: Ensure that clicking the "Delete" button correctly adds the card to the deletedCards state.
1. Intergration Tests:
    - State Persistence: After performing actions like expanding a card or deleting it, refresh the page (using "Refresh") and check that the state persists (e.g., expanded and deleted cards remain in the same state).
